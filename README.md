# Descriptive-Tactor-Feedback
UC Davis Masters Code Repo

The Descriptive Tactor Feedback was developed with both Arduino and Python. Arduino was used to run the servo motor and control the pace of the experimentation. Python was used to sync up the arduino and the National Instruments NI-DAQ together to collect data and send it to csv files. Included in the python folder was the initial but failed idea of fully controlling the arduino solely through python through the Pyfirmata protocol and API.
